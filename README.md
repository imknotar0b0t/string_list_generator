# string_list_generator
A Python 3 script to create every possible string combination for 1 through n in length 

I am sure there are more efficient ways of accomplishing what I did, but after spending a morning drinking coffee and poking at it, I stopped caring when I realized I could not get past 4 characters in length with my laptop, and I had no desire to write the output to hundreds or possibly thousands of file on disk just to say I did it. With a few slight modifications, I am sure I could.

v3 was an attempt to take longer lengths and break them down into managable sizes and the create the larger list. Still doesn't matter... 6^2 * 6^3 = 6^5 = 916,132,832 = my laptop sounding like a jet taking off when RAM usage gets to 97%.
